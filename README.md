Firstly, I created a simple rule-based chatbot using Python.

The chatbot runs in the terminal and interacts with the user using text input and predefined responses.

I used input() to take user queries and simple if-elif conditions to match responses.

The chatbot handles greetings, simple questions, and includes an option to exit by typing 'exit'.

To make the experience better, I added timestamps using datetime to show when each message was sent.

Finally, this chatbot project is useful for beginners to understand the basics of human-computer interaction using Python.
